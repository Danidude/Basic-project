We would like to thank our supervisors Folke Haugland and Jaran Nilsen for their constructive feedback that has led to progress in times when the project was at a stand still. We would also like to thank Integrasco for letting us use their office to store the server and work in, and University of Agder for lending us the server.\\\\
