Complex taxonomies delivers bad search performance for Integrasco. This report is about troubleshooting the issue and developing a solution based on a hypothesis stating that several smaller taxonomies in sum performs better than one large taxonomy. Testing indicated optimization potential in splitting. This sparked the creation of a query splitter to decrease response time in a sharded environment on Solr. This splitter proved to give improved performance when a taxonomy performs poorly with the regular search. Despite a problem relating to searches with high start offset, this can be a beneficial solution for the problem.
